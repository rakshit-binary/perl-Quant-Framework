=head1 NAME

Quant::Framework::Dividend - A module to save/load dividends 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module saves/loads dividends data to/from Chronicle. 
To save dividends for a company:

my $corp_dividends = Quant::Framework::Dividends->new(symbol => $symbol,
        rates => { 1 => 0, 2 => 1, 3=> 0.04 }
        discrete_points => { '2015-04-24' => 0, '2015-09-09' => 0.134 });
 $corp_dividends->save;

To read dividends information for a company:

 my $corp_dividends = Quant::Framework::Dividends->new(symbol => $symbol);

 my $rates = $corp_dividends->rates;
 my $disc_points = $corp_dividends->discrete_points;

=head2 for_date

        # We have to use the oldest available surface.. and we don't really know when it
        # was relative to where we are now.. so just say it's from the requested day.
